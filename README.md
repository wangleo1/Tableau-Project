# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
To investigate the potential factors impacting Airbnb prices within the state of New York by analyzing Airbnb host data ranging from 2008-2015

## Process
1. Gather information on Airbnb host data
2. Import dataset in Tableau to investigate information
3. Analyze categories and data types through inspection and data visualization
4. Identify trends, patterns and outliers
5. Generate hypothesis, potential question and points of interest
6. Create visualizations including maps, tables and graphs to present findings to potential audiences
7. Construct dashboards consisting sheets created in previous step
8. Present findings

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

## Challenges 
- Tableau's lack of geographical information on NYC's boroughs requiring the addition of further spatial files
- Organising visualizations in a manner which depicts a story

## Future Goals
- Investigate relationship with time series data instead of cross sectional
- Look at other potential variables such as seasonality 
- Create regression models to test strength explanatory variables
